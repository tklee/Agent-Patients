note that you need to have verbnet installed, and also the Inspector java program that's at Martha Palmer's home website.

This shell script just simply searches the verbnet database for a matching verb, and given the syntax, e.g. NP V NP, it prints out whether
that syntax can be written as Agent V Patient, or other.
